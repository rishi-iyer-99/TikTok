UPDATE 06/21/10: TikTok added detection of pyppeteer for scraping of data, so the TikTok API is currently not usable.

This is the code used to scrape TikTok daily and gather information about specifc sounds to track their growth through multiple metrics.
The information is then used for promotional purposes, to show artists the potential growth and outreach possible if they paid famous TikTokers to make videos using their songs.
